    "## 1. Short Answer Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "TensorFlow and PyTorch are two of the most widely used deep learning frameworks today. While they serve similar purposes, they differ significantly in how they operate and are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TensorFlow** (developed by Google) uses a **static computation graph**, meaning the model architecture is defined before execution. This approach offers performance benefits, especially in production environments. TensorFlow integrates well with:\n",
    "  - **TensorBoard** (for visualization)\n",
    "  - **TensorFlow Lite** (for mobile deployment)\n",
    "  - **TensorFlow Serving** (for model deployment)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PyTorch** (developed by Facebook AI Research) uses a **dynamic computation graph**, which is built on-the-fly during execution. This makes PyTorch highly flexible and intuitive, particularly useful in research where models change frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to choose:**\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Use **TensorFlow** for production environments, robust deployment, or mobile/edge devices.\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Use **PyTorch** for research, experimentation, and ease of debugging with Pythonic code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "PyTorch is often preferred in **academia and research**, while TensorFlow is widely adopted in **industry and production** settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are essential in AI and data science as they combine code, output, visualization, and documentation in a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  \n",
    "   Before training models, Jupyter allows step-by-step exploration of datasets using Python and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. This helps detect patterns, outliers, or class distributions, and allows documentation using markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rapid Prototyping and Experimentation:**  \n",
    "   Developers can test small code blocks incrementally, adjust hyperparameters, evaluate models, and visualize progress without leaving the notebook. This makes it ideal for quick iteration and collaborative sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "spaCy is a modern NLP library optimized for industrial use. Unlike basic string methods like `.split()`, `.find()`, or `.replace()`, spaCy brings linguistic intelligence to text processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Enhancements:\n",
    "- **Context-Aware Tokenization:**  \n",
    "  spaCy handles punctuation, contractions, and special entities correctly (e.g., treating \"U.S.A.\" as one token).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part-of-Speech Tagging and Dependency Parsing:**  \n",
    "  spaCy identifies grammatical roles (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) and syntactic relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**  \n",
    "  spaCy can extract key entities from text such as:\n",
    "  - ‚ÄúApple‚Äù ‚Üí *Organization*\n",
    "  - ‚ÄúBeats‚Äù ‚Üí *Organization*\n",
    "  - ‚Äú2014‚Äù ‚Üí *Date*\n",
    "  - ‚Äú$3 billion‚Äù ‚Üí *Money*\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make spaCy ideal for chatbots, document classification, and information extraction ‚Äî far beyond what simple string manipulation can achieve.\n",
    "\n",

    "| **Ease of Use**          | Very beginner-friendly with a consistent API (`.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.score()`).                    | Slightly complex; uses computational graphs. TensorFlow 2.x is more user-friendly with Keras.   |\n",
    "| **Community Support**    | Mature and strong community; widely used in academia and traditional ML projects.                     | Very active community in deep learning, backed by Google with rich documentation and tools.     |\n",

    "- Use **TensorFlow** for developing deep learning models, large-scale training, and production deployments.\n"
